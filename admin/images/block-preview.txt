This is a placeholder for the block-preview.png image.

In a production environment, this would be a PNG image showing a preview of the Moon or Mars voting block in the Gutenberg editor.

The image would display:
1. A space-themed background with stars
2. The title "Moon or Mars Poll"
3. Two options showing the Moon and Mars with their respective SVG illustrations
4. A simplified version of the voting interface

For a real implementation, you would need to create this image using a graphics editor and save it as PNG format.
